# RepoWatcher

GitHub organization repository watcher.  [![tested with jest](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested_with-jest-99424f.svg)](https://github.com/facebook/jest)

The goal of this web service is to support a notification to an GitHub organization administrator when an GitHub organization repository is deleted.  When the required activity takes place, an issue is logged in another configurable repository, containing the activity detail.

While the focus is to capture and report delete events, the service is configurable to support additional events such as created and archived.  For the full list of supported events, see [Repository Event API](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#repositoryevent).

## Getting Started

The next few sections provide details on creating a valid GitHub environment, enabling webhook notification and api access, and hosting the RepoWatcher web service.

### Technical Stack

GitHub
  * GitHub organizations and repositories
  * [GitHub Webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/) - push notification from GitHub
  * [GitHub REST API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/) - programmatic interface into GitHub 
Web Service
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - runtime environment (tested v8.1.3, however versions as early as v6.12.2  should function)
  * [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - http web server
  * [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - http web client 
  * Development environment only
    * [Typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) - typed JavaScript provider
    * [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) - task based development processes
    * [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) - unit testing
  * [Docker](https://www.docker.com) - easy to use deployment container for web service

### Prerequisites

In order to utilize this web service application, the following perquisites must be available.
  * A GitHub organization
  * An administrative user supporting the GitHub organization
  * A GitHub repository within the required organization to accept the pushed issues.
  * A Docker hosting platform capable of accepting incoming http requests to support the web service
  * A single http port will be required for the http request.  This may require additional firewall configurations.  See your cloud provider (cloud hosted) or network administrator (on premise) for help configuring.

### Installing

#### Organizations

Organizations - Utilize an existing organization or create a new one
    
  1. Log into your GitHub account.
  2. After login, on the header bar of GitHub.com, click on the _+_ symbol, providing a menu to create a new organization.
  3. Enter a unique organization name, a billing email, and choose a plan that best meets your organization requirements.
  4. Click the _Create organization_ button at the bottom to complete.

Organization Repositories

  1. On the main organization page (also found at https://github.com/<Organization>) click the _New_ button to begin creating repositories.
  2. Enter an organizational unique repository name, description, and choose if it will be a public or private repository.
  3. After entering all options, click the _Create repository_ button at the bottom to complete.
      
* Designate a repository to hold the pushed change issues (note the full organization and repository name like org/repo).

  * [Create Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/)

#### API Access

In order to communicate with the GitHub REST API, setup and obtain an API access token which will be utilized in the web service.  This allows GitHub to know it is communicating with an authorized user.
    
  1. Log into your GitHub organizational administrator account.
  2. Under profile settings, choose developer settings.
  3. Generate new token (you'll need re-validate your password at this point). 
  4. Enter a description for the token (why it is being used) and choose the scope for the token.  For this web service, choose _public_repo_ and notifications.  The service will just be listening for deleted changes, but will not actually be doing the repository deletion.
  5. Click the _Generate token_ button at the bottom to complete.  **Save the generated token immediately - You can't retrieve it later!**  It will be used in the later configuration.

#### Web Service
  * The web service is a node application hosted by a Docker container.  By default, the web service listens on HTTP port _3005_.  However, you can expose any port you would like and route it through the container configuration.
  * In addition to the port configuration, environment variables should be set to properly configure the service.  For convenience, there is a .env file that is included in the project which can be used during development, however, during production, the environment variables should be injected into the Node process from the command line or some other container configuration.
   * **PORT** - Exposed ttp port for the web service.  The default is _3005_.
   * **ACTIONS** - Used to authorize which GitHub notification actions should be handled by the web service.  Pipe delimit (no spaces) the actions.  Available actions can be found at [Repository Events](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#repositoryevent)
	ACTIONS = deleted|created 
    * **AUDIT_REPO** - The full repository name to the GitHub organization repository that will be store the notification issues.  This found in the Configuration-->Organization steps above.
	AUDIT_REPO = GuarrdonOrg1/DeleteHistory 
    * **SECURITY_TOKEN** - Environment variable used to store the api key obtained from Configuration-->API Access steps above
	SECURITY_TOKEN = aaa1bbb2ccc3ddd4eee5fff6ggg7
    * **AUDIT_USER**  - Any users to mention in the body of the issue 
	AUDIT_USER=@Guarrdon
  * Docker
    * While docker is not required to host the web service, the docker image has been uploaded to the public Docker Hub at **guarrdon/githubchangehandler** fro convenience.  Those familiar with Docker and the deployment benefits can utilize the docker command below to load.  Alternatively, the web service Node project can be run manually - just ensure the environment variables are injected into the process.
    * There are a few cloud providers and management tools to choose to support your Docker instance (AWS EC2, Kubernetes, Portainer, â€¦).  Please review documentation specific to those platforms to execute the web service container.  When using a separate manage tool, the required environment variable are typically set from the user interface or in a .yaml configuration file.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: github-change-handler
  labels:
    purpose: notification-watch-issue-push
spec:
  containers:
    name: github-change-handler-container
    image: guarrdon/githubchangehandler:latest
    env:
      name: PORT
      value: "3005"
      name: ACTIONS
      value: "create|deleted"
      name: AUDIT_REPO
      value: "GuarrdonOrg1/DeleteHistory"
      name: SECURITY_TOKEN
      value: "aaa1bbb2ccc3ddd4eee5fff6ggg7"
      name: AUDIT_USER
      value: "@Guarrdon"
```

    * To run your container directly from the Docker console, run the following command.  Note, the environment variables - denoted with -e - will need to be configured with the organization specific information.  Additionally, this example supports both the deleted and created actions.

```bash
docker run --name githubchangehandler -d -e ACTIONS="deleted|created" -e AUDIT_REPO="GuarrdonOrg1/DeleteHistory" -e SECURITY_TOKEN="aaa1bbb2ccc3ddd4eee5fff6ggg7" -e AUDIT_USER="@Guarrdon" -p 3005:3005 guarrdon/githubchangehandler 
```

#### WebHook

In order to receive push notifications from GitHub, a Webhook must be enabled within the organization.  This Webhook contains the HTTP REST entry point for the web service to support the notification.  During configuration, you will be able to select which events will trigger the webhook integration.  For this web service, the Repository events are required.
  
  1. On the main organization page (also found at https://github.com/<Organization>) click the _Settings_ menu option.
  2. Under organization settings, choose Webhooks.
  3. Click _Add Webhook_. 
  4. Enter the url where the web service will be accepting push notification.  An example might be http://<yourhost.org>:3005/api/github/changeRepoHandler.  Note the port number in the address.  It must match the configured port.
  5. Choose _application/json_ for Content type.
  6. Select the individual events that will trigger the Webhook. To support this web server, choose the _Repository_ events. 
  7. Click the _Create (or update) Webhook_ button to complete.  An immediate ping request will be sent to the web service to validate it's availability.  See the _Test Section_ below for more information.
  
Reference
  * Review the [Creating Webhook Help Page](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/#setting-up-a-webhook) for additional information. 

### Execution

The web service exposes two methods:
  * **POST  /api/github/changeRepoHandler**
    * Used by the GitHub webhook to 
    * Incoming parameters - Request payload from GitHub notification webhook
    * Success
      * _HTTP 200_ Successful process and issue push.
      * _HTTP 202_ Ping accepted but does not process.
      * _HTTP 202_ Actions not suported.
    * Errors
      * _HTTP 400_ GitHub repository cannot be null.
      * _HTTP 400_ invalid arguments.
      * _HTTP 500_ Configuration invalid.
      * _HTTP 500_ Failed to push issue.
  
  * **GET  /api/getDate**
    * Used for testing to ensure the service is up and running
    * There are no parameters required and will return the current date and time
    * Once the service is running, any webserver can access this test method

## Tests

Once GitHub webhook is created, a ping request is sent to the notification URL.  If The service is configured properly, the ping will respond with an _HTTP 202_ response.  You can view these ping operations, as well as the last few action notifications that were delivered in the webhook settings --> recent deliveries area.  In the event you would like to replay the notification request, press the Redeliver button and the request will attempt to process again.  The result will post in the response tab.  A response other than that of _HTTP 200_ for a correctly configured action and _HTTP 202_ for a ping are exceptions and require additional troubleshooting.
